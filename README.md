# Lord of the Rings - Fellowship - Europe - Version 1.0 Fix:

The launcher fixes the problem with the game freezing on a blackscreen on startup.

simply put the D3D8.DLL and D3D8.INI and levellist.txt and FellowshipLauncher.exe from this fix into your game folder next to the game exe and your good to go, use FellowshipLauncher to launch and play the game instead of using Fellowship.exe, if you wish 
you can make a shortcut of FellowshipLauncher.exe on your desktop. 

choose your AspectRatio in the ini from the setting fullscreenaspectratio all aspect ratios supported are listed, use the number next to the one you wish to use, this will unlock all resolutions for that aspect ratio in the game,
under options, graphics settings, resolution choose your resolution there then play. This also automatically calculates FOV in the game based on the aspect ratio you choose in the INI. 
Default for aspect ratio in ini is fullscreenaspectratio = 4 (16:9) change it to the aspect ratio you wish to use.

all other settings can be edited in D3D8.INI

Default for FPS is 60 you can change it in d3d8.ini. be aware that going above 60fps in this game may cause issues.

IMPORTANT:
if you have your game installed to your C drive then you will have to run the launcher as administrator if it doesnt work 
or right click your fellowship folder where all the game files are and go to properties and security and tick all the box's.
